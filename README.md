This is the GitHub.io presence for the CHHS Office of Innovation. The WordPress site is referred to this site. This site houses information about the office, the official communications and outreach calendars, the playbook and open source innovation places for collaboration. 

Cohort 1 created the content and structure for the site during the Agile the Right Way workshop. It was a great workshop and produced a site with 90% of the stuff I wanted on it.
